# hello-http

This is a repository I created to help my sister studying JS, more specifically managing HTTP API requests using JS.  
The content here is very simple and focused on helping people to learn.

### Exercises

They are all described in ["exercises"](./exercises/readme.md) folder.

### Spell API ðŸ§™

To do the exercices you'll need to up our own API, to do that, type...

```bash
# Simple as that!
make

# Want to reset the database and start fresh?
make reset-databse
```

| Method | Endpoint       | Description               | Body Example                     |

| GET    | `/spells/:id`  | Get a specific spell       | â€“                                |
